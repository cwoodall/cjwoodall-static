## What am I doing _now_?

What a year so far! I had an awesome ice season way back in the beginning of 2019, started a new job at Apricity, and spent a month traveling/working in Seattle, WA, Bend, OR and Canmore, AB, Canada. I  went on my first backpacking trip to the Alpine Lakes wilderness and followed that up immediately with a trip to the Bugaboos in the Canadian Rockies as my first basecamping alpine climbing trip. It was exciting and beautiful!

I have been toying with a few different ideas for personal projects. I will update more on these as
I commit to and develop them. I also finished up hooking up my friend Emmett's bed to Amazon Alexa.

### My priorities are:

- Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Apricity. Focusing on improving our software development
  processes and performing some software archeaology on legacy code. Working on my refactoring and
  legacy code tweaking skills.
- Thinking about how to share my personal projects most effectively (influenced by
  [Share Your Work]() and [Derek Sivers]()).
- Trail running and training for a half marathon!
- Training my climbing so that I can send a few more 10s on trad before the end of the season.
