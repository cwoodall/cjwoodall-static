## What am I doing _now_?

Work has been intensifying lately, it is very exciting! I have been climbing outside
enjoying the end of the climbing seasons and starting to get some excitement going
for the winter sports season. I am trying to post more here to share more of my
work and my influences! Also, I recently signed up for Amazon Affiliates so I
can post affiliate links for the music, books and tools I enjoy.

Thinking about doing some traveling after Christmas, feel free to suggest good
locations! Some potential ideas are: Argentina, Chile, Joshua Tree, Spain, and
similar areas that might not be too cold. No climbing required.

Recently I went through some of my older music and found some cool stuff! You should
check out what I [posted](/music).

### My priorities are:

- Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology. Doing some work on
  building a good embedded workflow, and a solid API base for us.
- Thinking about how to share my personal projects most effectively (influenced by
  [Share Your Work]() and [Derek Sivers]()).
- Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on.
  - It involves Arduinos, nrf24 radios and some RGB LED strips. Some code is available on [Github](https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights). I hope to write up some more when
	the time allows.
- Learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) and trying to aid in the [embedded-rust](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-rust/blob/scope/text/0000-scope.md) RFC effort.
- Appreciating life, journaling, and learning a little about [Stoicism](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614) and other philosophies of life.
- Helping establish the [Boston Embedded Systems Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Embedded-Systems-Meetup/) with [Isaac Gutekunst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaachg)! Join us!
- Taking the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home)!
