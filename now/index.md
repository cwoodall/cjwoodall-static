## What am I doing _now_?

The rock climbing season has been over for a while now and I have been focusing my weekends on ice climbing and skiing. I skiied for the first time
New Years weekend and have really been enjoying it and want to get better. I started falling a lot, but am now far more comfortable. I am also gearing up for rock season and plan to start a training cycle soon to prepare for a trip to Red Rocks, NV in April.

As for my personal projects, I got a lot of work done on [Flicker Lights](https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights) and [Rusty Nail](http://cwoodall.com/rusty-nail) and moved my website to GitHub Pages hosting. I have been enjoying Rust and am working with the Boston Embedded Systems meetup to introduce more people to Rust on Embedded Systems.

### My priorities are:

- Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology, focusing on communications inside of our robot `burt`.
- Thinking about how to share my personal projects most effectively (influenced by
  [Share Your Work]() and [Derek Sivers]()).
- Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on, caled [flicker-lights](https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights). I hope to write up some more when
	the time allows.
- Working on [rusty-nail](http://cwoodall.com/rusty-nail) which is a barbot powered by Rust.
- Helping establish the [Boston Embedded Systems Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Embedded-Systems-Meetup/) with [Isaac Gutekunst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaachg)! Join us!
- Learning how to ski!
- Thinking about how to use my skillset to preserve human rights in our new reality and build a better future for all. This admittedly has been causing some anxiety.
