		<p>For some of my classical music see <a href="http://cwoodall.bandcamp.com/">The Chris Woodall Bandcamp Page</a></p>

		<p>For some more some electronic music see <a href="http://noshoes.bandcamp.com/">No Shoes</a></p>

		<p>All of the music listed above is from when I was in high school. I have also found a few scores I will post shortly. To me the classical music is better and the mixing of the electronic music is best for headphones.</p>
