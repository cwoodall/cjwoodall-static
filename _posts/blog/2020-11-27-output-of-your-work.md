A few years ago, while in the middle of a big product release, I turned to a co-worker and asked them: 
__What is the output of your work?__

It is easy to get lost in the idea that what you produce is the
gizmo, gadget, or direct creative output of whatever it is you are doing. If you paint you produce a
painting, if you write music you produce a song, you work on a product and you produce that product.
That you put your effort in to take ideas, and materials and despite all odds create a tactile output
of some sort or another. However, on further inspection I found that while that is one output of your
work, it is more a side-effect, and the main output is information or knowledge on how to produce
that output.

In many ways worrying and working solely towards the physical outputs, is seeking rewards. While searching
for the knowledge and wisdom inherent in the activities of work, compling it to create knowledge (that
can be shared within an organization), and then reflecting on it to glean some wisdom is in many is
engagement in the action. To find beauty in the facts, the failures, the successes of your actions.
It is being process-oriented. In some ways this reminds me of the following excerpt from the **Bhagavad Gita**:

>  You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction. 
> - [Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2, Verse 47](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/47)


It would be misleading to say that this is so cut and dry. If you now focus only on process, then maybe you wont ever make anything. Sometimes there are great pressures placed on us to produce output so that we can continue. These moments, maybe, have the most to teach us about process orientation. In technology development, it is my belief that these moments create technical debt, but also create great leaps forward. Once again, maybe the technical debt, the messyness, the understanding of the mistakes made is the truely valuable output of your work.

It has been my experience that it is tempting to look back at this as a failure of procedure, or a bad thing. However, the actions earned you a spot at the table, the right to play, and now you have information available! Information can be processed to knowledge, and maybe someday become organizational wisdom!

So I ask you to occasionally reflect on your work, and ask: **What is the output of my work?**
