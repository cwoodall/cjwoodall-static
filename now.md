## What am I doing _now_?

I am spending a lot of my time working at Barrett Technology which is currently
a priority for me. I have also been climbing at [Brookyln Boulders](http://brooklynboulders.com)
and outside at Farley, Crow Hill and in N. Conway. Hiking has been a growing interest
for me and I hope to snag a few more peaks before winter and do some winter hiking.

Recently I went through some of my older music and found some cool stuff! You should
check out what I [posted](/music.html).

### My priorities are:

- Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology. Working hard right now.
- Climbing and enjoying Sendtember and Rocktober! I did Pinnacle Buttress which was an amazing experience.
- Reading about Bletchley Park, Ultra and Enigma. [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Seizing-Enigma-German-U-Boats-1939-1943/dp/0395427398)
- Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on.
  - It involves Arduinos, nrf24 radios and some RGB LED strips. Some code is available on [Github](https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights). I hope to write up some more when
	the time allows.
- Learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org)
- Appreciating life, journaling, and learning a little about Stoicism and other philosophies of life.
- Enjoying MathJax: Its $$alg\frac{ebr}{aic}$$
