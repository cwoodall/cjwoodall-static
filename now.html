			<h2>What I'm doing now?</h2>

			<p>
        I'm spending most of my time in Somerville, MA climbing at Brookyln Boulders and working at Barrett Technology a robotics company in Newton, MA.
				I have been taking up more running, hiking and other outdoor activities besides climbing do to a string of minor injuries wich have been keeping
				me off of the ground. I am also starting to work on some projects.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>My priorities are:</b>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology. Working hard right now.</li>
        <li>Climbing and enjoying Sendtember and Rocktober! I did Pinnacle Buttress which was an amazing experience.</li>
        <li>Reading about Bletchley Park, Ultra and Enigma. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seizing-Enigma-German-U-Boats-1939-1943/dp/0395427398">(Amazon)</a></li>
				<li>Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on. It involves Arduinos, nrf24 radios and some RGB LED strips. Some code is available on <a href="https://github.com/cwoodall/flicker-lights">Github</a></li>
				<li>Appreciating life, journaling, and learning a little about Stoicism and other philosophies of life.</li>
      </ul>
