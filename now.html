			<h2>What I'm doing now?</h2>

			<p>
        I'm spending most of my time in Somerville, MA climbing at Brookyln Boulders and working at Barrett Technology a robotics company in Newton, MA.
				I have been taking up more running, hiking and other outdoor activities besides climbing do to a string of minor injuries wich have been keeping
				me off of the ground. I am also starting to work on some projects.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>My priorities are:</b>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Working as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Barrett Technology</li>
        <li>Recovering from minor injuries so that I can enjoy climbing, and hiking this wonderful Fall season. I want to get up the Whitney Gillman Ridge (5.7).</li>
        <li>Starting to read more frequently again. I just finished The Diamond Age, and plan on reading Breakfast of Champions and Foundation and Empire next.</li>
        <li>Appreciating life, journaling, meditating and building a positive life philosophy.</li>
				<li>Finishing an LED project for a tap dance my significant other is working on. It involves Arduinos, nrf24 radios and some RGB LED strips. I am excited.</li>
      </ul>
