			<h2>What I'm doing now?</h2>

			<p>
        I'm spending most of my time in Somerville, MA climbing at Brookyln Boulders and working at Barrett Technology a robotics company in Newton, MA.
        My new job required purchasing a car, so I am getting used to the responsibilites, benefits and pitfalls of car ownership too.
