A few years ago, while in the middle of a big product release, I turned to a co-worker and asked them: 
__What is the output of your work?__

It is easy to get lost in the idea that what you produce is the
gizmo, gadget, or direct creative output of whatever it is you are doing. If you paint you produce a
painting, if you write music you produce a song, if you work on a product and you produce that product... On further inspection I found that while the direct goal is often one output of your work, in many ways is more a side-effect. In this view the main output is the information, and experience of having done the work and how to produce a given output.

If you focus only on the final goal, and reward, you might miss the experience of doing the work. Doing this you might also lose the information that doing the work gives you, to improve in the future, and share what you have learnt with others. Without these raw materials that are produced through the creative process then you may leave with a painting, but know new knowledge! And with no new knowledge we cannot reflect to glean some wisdom from our experiences.

To find beauty in the facts, the failures, the successes of your actions.
It is being process-oriented. In some ways this reminds me of the following excerpt from the **Bhagavad Gita**:

>  You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction. 
> - [Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2, Verse 47][0]

It would be misleading to say that this is so cut and dry. If you now focus only on process, then maybe you wont ever make anything. Sometimes there are great pressures placed on us to produce output so that we can continue. These moments, maybe, have the most to teach us about process orientation. In technology development, it is my belief that these moments create technical debt, but also create great leaps forward. Once again, maybe the technical debt, the messiness, the understanding of the mistakes made is the truly valuable output of your work.

It has been my experience that it is tempting to look back at this as a failure of procedure, or a bad thing. However, the actions earned you a spot at the table, the right to play, and now you have information available! Information can be processed to knowledge, and maybe someday become organizational wisdom!

So I ask you to occasionally reflect on your work, and ask: **What is the output of my work?**
