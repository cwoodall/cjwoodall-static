I have been learning [Rust][rust] lately, which has been an awesome and
rewarding experience thus far. However, at work, and on many of my embedded side
projects I use `C` and `C++` quite extensively. But error handling ends up being
a major pain point and can make an otherwise rather simple API into a disaster,
especially if you are committed to avoiding throwing exceptions for various
performance and real-time reliability issues. This is where Rust's model comes
in as a possibly solution (or at the very least an interesting one): the use of
the `Result<T, E>` types and the `Option<T>` type. For the time being I am going to concentrate on the `Option<T>` type and write about the `Result<T, E>` type in a future post.

**So what is this `Option<T>` thing any way?**

`Option<T>` represents a value which is either a type `T` (like an `int`, `float`, or `MyFancyClass`) or `Nothing`. It is a pretty simple concept.
This makes and `Option<T>` type very good at representing the class of errors
where either you returned the correct result, *or* you just couldn't finish the
computation for some reason. To some degree this is already represented at C. If
you check for errors by passing or returning a pointer and checking if it is a
null pointer or not, that is a really brittle version of the `Option<T>` type.
It is either some value or `NULL`/`nullptr`. For example, below is an
implementation of divide which performs the computation $$\frac{a}{b}$$ but
returns a nullptr if it fails:

```c++
void divide(int a, int b, int *c) {
  if (b == 0) {
    c == nullptr
  } else {
    *c = a/b;
  }
}

int main(void) {
  int c;
  divide(10, 0, &c);
  if (c != nullptr) {
    printf("I got a %d\n", c);
  } else {
    printf("You divided by 0... the world blew up... Thanks");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
<!-- ** -->

Another option, which is much safer from a memory perspective, is to return an
error or success flag (in this case I will use a `bool` with `true` indicating
success and `false` indicating failure):

```c++
bool divide(int a, int b, int *c) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return false; // oh no...
  } else {
    *c = a/b;
    return true; // success!
  }
}  

int main(void) {
  int c;
  bool ret = divide(10, 0, &c);
  if (ret) {
    printf("I got a %d\n", c);
  } else {
    printf("You divided by 0... the world blew up... Thanks");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
<!-- ** -->

So what is wrong with the above two solutions? _Nothing_. However, they are
syntactically a little burdensome, and you can always just bypass the check and
read the pointer, which may even be pointing at invalid data. Languages like
Rust have an `Option<T>` type ([wiki][wiki-option]), also known as `Maybe` in
Haskell and `Optional` in Swift. This type would allows you to return
"something" or "nothing". So lets see an example of the divide program written
with a yet to be implemented `Option<T>` type.

```c++
Option<int> divide(int a, int b) noexcept {
  if (b == 0) {
    return Nothing();
  } else {
    return Some(a/b);
  }
}

int main(void) {
  auto result = divide(10, 0);
  if (!!result) { // Check that result is not Nothing
    printf("I got a %d\n", result.unwrap());
  } else {
    printf("You divided by 0... the world blew up... Thanks");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

So what are the benefits over the other divide-by-zero safe `divide()`
implementations?

1. No need to return a separate `success` or `error` type. Could be a possible
   optimization.
2. Natural calling semantics where the value being returned is the value you
   wanted to return.
3. No need to allocate an int ahead of time and pass it as a pointer, or
   reference.

> Woah so cool
*Requirements*:

1. Should add very little overhead over type T.
1. Should have minimal `std` library dependencies.
1. Should be stable and reliable, with as few hacks as possible.
1. Never panics or throws...
1. Should work on POD types, would be nice if it worked on more complicated data
   types.

With this in mind we can start to move on. My first, rather naive approach was
the following:

```c++
template<typename T>
class Option {
public:
  Option(T t) : isSomething(true), something(t) {}
  Option() : isSomething(false), something() {}

  void operator=(const T &s) {
    isSomething = true;
    something = s;
  }

  bool operator!(void) const { return !isSomething; }
  explicit operator bool() const {
    return isSomething;
  }

  T operator*(void) const { return something; }
  T unwrap(void) const { return something; }

private:
  bool isSomething;
  T something;
};
```
