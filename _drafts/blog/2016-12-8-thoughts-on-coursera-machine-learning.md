I completed my first [Coursera][coursera] course: [Machine Learning][ml-course]
with [Andrew Ng][andrew-ng] from [Stanford][stanford]. The course was well
taught and concentrates on building a solid base for applying
[Machine Learning][ml-wiki] to a variety of problems. Andrew Ng uses simplified
examples but examples motivated by real problem which demonstrate the
application of the algorithm. Early on the tools are built up to gradient descent
to solve logistic and linear regression problems, and that particular
optimization algorithm is used over and over again. I found that the formulation
used in the course was easy to understand, and I understood the origin
of an algorithm I had been rederived in the past.
