I just got myself the Anker Equipment 
screw holder. This thing was $45.00 and holds
12 screws. It even has a little pouch in the middle which can fit a 10cm screw, or file 
depending on what you want to use it for.

I found 

Notes:

- Fits 12 screws nicely and folds up to a managable size.

- The closure mechanism is more reliable and easier to operate than the black diamond one.

- The material is thin; but feels very solid. 
- There are 2 rather burly loops on it, I think you can use these to hang or secure the screw holder relatively easy.

I am generally impressed.

Get some field usage shots.
