_[Good Omens]_ is a collaboration between [Terry Pratchett] and [Neil Gaiman]
which I listened to as an audiobook. A humorous, satirical and biting novel
about the apocalypse, starring a demon who is not so bad, an angel who is not
so good, and an anti-christ who just wants to play with his friends. I found it
to be hilarious, with a lot of really funny social and religious commentary, and
would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little bit of levity on the
subject of the end of times, which, given the state of the nation, everyone
might need.
